# 📊 Counter Web App

A simple, responsive **counter application** built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. This app allows users to increase, decrease, or reset a number. It provides real-time feedback using animations, sounds, and color changes — with the current count saved using `localStorage` to persist data across page reloads.
